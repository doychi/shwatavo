# Shwatavo
Shwatavo is a role-playing campaign management tool to help build the campaign background, relationships and sessions in away that allows information to be revealed to individual characters right time. 

## Status
**Concept** - Currnetly Shwatavo is a concept that I have had for about ten years and I'm trying to develop the concept again.

## Goal
The goal of Shwatavo is to provide a web based system that allows:
1. Game masters to develop background and setting for their campaign;
2. Information to be revealed at the right time to characters, by games masters and players a like at the right time; and
3. Work well for games of all sizes.

## Project Setup

### Requirements
Like most programmers I find it tedious to write documentation I see it as incredibly important for keeping focused.  To that end I will be experimenting with user stories as issues, as outlined in jvandemo's [GitHub Scrum Workflow](https://github.com/jvandemo/github-scrum-workflow) project.

For now, that's about all I have.
